# frontend
This directory is to be used for the web-app that we will use to test our database queries on.

# Building and Running
From the root repo directory, run the following commands:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> NOTE: The project utilizes a frontend and a backend. Please note that the database calls of the web-app will not work without the server running in the background. To do that, view the [backend documentation](backend/README.md)
