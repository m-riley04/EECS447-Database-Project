# EECS447-Database-Project

# Building and Testing
The way you can test our MariaDB database/SQL code is through our simple web-app (using Node.js nad React Vite) we created that simulates a library's website.

There is a backend and a frontend that must be ran at the same time. There are 3 ways to build and test this:
1. Running `start.py` (Recommended and cross-platform. Requires Python)
2. Running `start.sh` (Unix/Linux/Git Bash only)
3. Manually launching the frontend and backend (instructions can be found in the [frontend readme](frontend/README.md) and the [backend readme](backend/README.md))

# Dependencies
- Node.js v23.5.0
- Python 3.10+ (optional)
